# docker-disco-example
An example bot built on the `spencersharkey/disco` Docker image!

Writing, testing, and deploying a Discord bot in a few lines of code... no problem!

### How to start the bot (after building):
```
docker run -e "DISCORD_TOKEN=<YOUR DISCORD TOKEN HERE>" spencersharkey/disco-example
```

Be sure to replace `<YOUR DISCORD TOKEN HERE>` with your app's bot user token. You can manage your apps on on the [My Apps](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) page.
